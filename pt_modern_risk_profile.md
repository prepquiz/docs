## Abstract

Traditional emergency preparedness assessments often rely on outdated, static methods that fail to capture dynamic risk factors. PrepThis.ai introduces a modern, AI-powered approach based on a structured risk profiling methodology:

$$
\text{Risk} = \frac{\text{Hazard} \times \text{Vulnerability}}{\text{Resilience}}
$$

This paper outlines the theoretical foundations, survey methodology, AI integration, and real-world applications of PrepThis.ai for individuals, families, community groups, and organizations.

## Introduction

In today’s rapidly evolving risk landscape, static checklists and outdated hazard assessments are no longer sufficient. Academic research and global best practices define risk as a function of hazard, vulnerability, and resilience capacity. However, traditional assessments often lack dynamism, personalization, and scalability.

**PrepThis.ai** addresses these gaps by implementing a modern survey-driven model that quantifies individual and group risk profiles using academically validated principles. It then applies AI-driven, scenario-based training to build real-world preparedness.

PrepThis.ai targets adults, families, community groups, and organizations seeking to assess, strengthen, and maintain readiness through ongoing dynamic profiling and exercises.

## Foundations of Risk Profiling

Leading academic and government frameworks define disaster risk as:

$$
\text{Risk} = \text{Hazard} \times \text{Vulnerability}
$$

where **resilience** acts as a mitigating factor:

$$
\text{Effective Risk} = \frac{\text{Hazard} \times \text{Vulnerability}}{\text{Resilience}}
$$

This model underpins FEMA’s Hazard Vulnerability Assessment (HVA) methods and is reinforced by global initiatives such as the UN Hyogo Framework for Action.

**Key concepts:**
- **Hazard Exposure:** Probability and magnitude of potential disruptive events.
- **Vulnerability:** Susceptibility of people, systems, and assets to harm.
- **Resilience:** Ability to absorb, respond, and recover from disruptions.

PrepThis.ai operationalizes this formula by dynamically scoring users across all three axes through a structured digital survey.

## Methodology

PrepThis.ai’s methodology consists of two integrated components:

### Survey-Driven Risk Profiling

Users complete a structured survey built on five key dimensions:
- **Hazard Exposure:** Local threats and their likelihood (natural disasters, technological hazards, etc.)
- **Social and Physical Vulnerability:** Personal, infrastructural, and community susceptibilities.
- **Infrastructure Risk:** Critical dependencies and environmental fragility.
- **Resilience Capacity:** Existing preparedness resources, plans, and adaptive capabilities.
- **Awareness & Planning:** Situational knowledge, drills, and contingency readiness.

Each question is weighted, normalized to a 0–100 scale, and contributes to the overall composite score.

The final risk score is computed as:

$$
\text{Overall Risk} = \frac{\text{Hazard Score} \times \text{Vulnerability Score}}{\text{Resilience Score} + \varepsilon}
$$

where \( \varepsilon \) is a small constant (e.g., 0.01) to prevent division by zero.

### Risk Levels

The risk levels are defined as:

$$
\\text{Low Risk:} \\quad \\text{Risk} < 100
$$

$$
\\text{Moderate Risk:} \\quad 100 \\leq \\text{Risk} < 300
$$

$$
\\text{High Risk:} \\quad 300 \\leq \\text{Risk} < 600
$$

$$
\\text{Severe Risk:} \\quad \\text{Risk} \\geq 600
$$

### AI-Generated Scenario-Based Training

After profiling:
- **Personalized scenarios** are generated based on the user’s dominant hazards and vulnerabilities.
- **Interactive exercises** simulate emergencies and allow users to practice decision-making.
- **Team-based missions** foster collaboration among family, group, or organization members.

Scenario content is continuously adapted as users progress and update their profiles.

## Practical Applications

PrepThis.ai is designed for diverse audiences:
- **Individuals and Families:** Household-level risk awareness and tailored preparedness missions.
- **Community Groups:** Collective training exercises to enhance neighborhood resilience.
- **Organizations:** Workplace and operational continuity readiness through dynamic assessments and exercises.

Features include:
- Lightweight web architecture (React, Tailwind, Recharts).
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly deployment.
- Dynamic updates as conditions, team composition, or user knowledge evolves.

PrepThis.ai transitions emergency preparedness from a static, annual report into a **living, adaptive system**.

## Impact on Resilience Building

Community resilience research highlights that preparedness is maximized when:
- Risk is **localized and personalized**.
- Training involves **realistic, participatory simulations**.
- **Social bonds and group cohesion** are reinforced during preparation phases.

PrepThis.ai addresses all three by:
- Profiling specific local risks.
- Generating AI-driven situational simulations.
- Facilitating shared missions and drills.

As a result, users not only identify their risks but actively strengthen their response capabilities over time.

## Conclusion

PrepThis.ai represents a substantial advancement in emergency preparedness methodology. By applying a rigorous, academically supported risk profiling model and layering it with dynamic AI-generated training, it enables individuals, families, and organizations to build true resilience in a measurable, adaptive way.

This approach transitions emergency planning from theory to practice — empowering communities to understand their risks and act on them in real time.
